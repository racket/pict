@title{Typesetting Racket Code}

@defmodule[pict/code]{This library is re-provided by
                      @racketmodname[slideshow/code], but
                      initializes @racket[get-current-code-font-size].}

@defproc[(typeset-code [stx syntax?]) pict?]{

Produces a pict for code in the given @|stx-obj|. The
source-location information of the syntax object determines the line
breaks, line indenting, and space within a row.  Empty rows are
ignored. 

Beware that if you use @racket[read-syntax] on a file port, you may
have to turn on line counting via @racket[port-count-lines!] for the
code to typeset properly.

Normally, @racket[typeset-code] is used through the @racket[code]
syntactic form, which works properly with compilation, and that
escapes to pict-producing code via @racket[unsyntax]. See also
@racket[define-code].

Embedded picts within @racket[stx] are used directly. Row elements are
combined using and operator like @racket[htl-append], so use
@racket[code-align] (see below) as necessary to add an ascent to
ascentless picts. More precisely, creation of a line of code uses
@racket[pict-last] to determine the end point of the element most
recently added to a line; the main effect is that closing parentheses
are attached in the right place when a multi-line pict is embedded in
@racket[stx].

An identifier that starts with @litchar{_} is italicized in the pict,
and the @litchar{_} is dropped, unless the
@racket[code-italic-underscore-enabled] parameter is set to
@racket[#f]. Also, unless @racket[code-scripts-enabled] is set to
@racket[#f], @litchar{_} and @litchar{^} in the middle of a word
create superscripts and subscripts, respectively (like TeX); for
example @racketidfont{foo^4_ok} is displayed as the identifier
@racketidfont{foo} with a @racketidfont{4} superscript and an
@racketidfont{ok} subscript.

Further, uses of certain identifiers in @racket[stx] typeset
specially:

@itemize[

 @item{@as-index{@racketidfont{code:blank}} --- produces a space.}

 @item{@racket[(#,(as-index (racketidfont "code:comment")) _s ...)]
 --- produces a comment block, with each @racket[_s] on its own line,
 where each @racket[_s] must be a string or a pict.}

 @item{@racket[(#,(as-index (racketidfont "code:line")) _datum ...)]
 --- typesets the @racket[_datum] sequence, which is mostly useful for
 the top-level sequence, since @racket[typeset-code] accepts only one
 argument.}

 @item{@racket[(#,(as-index (racketidfont "code:contract")) _datum
 ...)]  --- like @racketidfont{code:line}, but every @racket[_datum]
 is colored as a comment, and a @litchar{;} is prefixed to every line.}

 @item{@racket[(#,(as-index (racketidfont "code:template")) _datum
 ...)]  --- like @racketidfont{code:line}, but a @litchar{;} is
 prefixed to every line.}

 @item{@racketidfont{$} --- typesets as a vertical bar (for no
 particularly good reason).}

@defform[(code datum ...)]{

The macro form of @racket[typeset-code]. Within a @racket[datum],
@racket[unsyntax] can be used to escape to an expression, and
identifiers bound as syntax to @tech{code transformer}s trigger
transformations.

should be used. The default is @racket['(quote quasiquote unquote
unquote-splicing syntax quasisyntax unsyntax unsyntax-splicing)].
Remove a symbol to suppress the corresponding reader output.}


@defproc[(code-align [pict pict?]) pict?]{

italicized (dropping the @litchar{_}). The default is @racket[#t].}

recognized in an identifier.}

@defform*[[(define-code code-id typeset-code-id) 
           (define-code code-id typeset-code-id escape-id)]]{

Defines @racket[code-id] as a macro that uses
@racket[typeset-code-id], which is a function with the same input as
@racket[typeset-code]. The @racket[escape-id] form defaults to
@racket[unsyntax].

The resulting @racket[code-id] syntactic form takes a sequence of
@racket[_datum]s:

@racketblock[
(code-id _datum ...)
]

It produces a pict that typesets the sequence. Source-location
information for the @racket[_datum] determines the layout of code in
the resulting pict. The @racket[code-id] is expanded in such a way
that source location is preserved during compilation (so
@racket[typeset-code-id] receives a syntax object with source
locations intact).

If a @racket[_datum] contains @racket[(escape-id _expr)]---perhaps as
@RACKET[#,_expr] when @racket[escape-id] is @racket[unsyntax]---then
the @racket[_expr] is evaluated and the result datum is spliced in
place of the @racket[escape-id] form in @racket[_datum]. If the result
is not a syntax object, it is given the source location of the
@racket[escape-id] form. A pict value injected this way as a
@racket[_datum] is rendered as itself.

If a @racket[_datum] contains @racket[(transform-id _datum ...)] or
@racket[transform-id] for a @racket[transform-id] that is bound as syntax to a
@tech{code transformer}, then the @racket[(transform-id _datum ...)]
or @racket[transform-id] may be replaced with an escaped expression,
depending on the @tech{code transformer}'s result.}

@defproc[(make-code-transformer [proc-or-stx (or/c (syntax? . -> . (or/c syntax? #f))
                                                   syntax?)])

@defthing[prop:code-transformer struct-type-property?]
@defproc[(code-transformer? [v any/c]) boolean?]
)]{

Exported @racket[for-syntax] for creating @deftech{code transformers}.

For @tech{code transformer} created with
@racket[(make-code-transformer _proc)], @racket[proc] takes a syntax
object representing the use of an identifier bound to the transformer,
and it produces an expression whose value replaces the identifier use
within a @racket[code] form or a form defined via
@racket[define-code].  Like a macro transformer, a code transformer is
triggered either by a use of the bound identifier in an
``application'' position, in which case the transformer receives the
entire ``application'' form, or the identifier by itself can also
trigger the transformer. The @tech{code transformer}'s @racket[_proc]
can return @racket[#f], in which case the use of the identifier is
left untransformed; if the identifier was used in an ``application''
position, the transformer @racket[_proc] will be called again for the
identifier use by itself.

A @tech{code transformer} produced by @racket[(make-code-transformer _stx)]
is equivalent to 

@racketblock[
(make-code-transformer (lambda (use-stx) 
                         (if (identifier? use-stx)
                             _stx
                             #f)))
]

A structure type with the @racket[prop:code-transformer] property
implements a @tech{code transformer}. The property value must be a
procedure of one argument, which receives the structure and returns a
procedure that is like a @racket[_proc] passed to
@racket[make-code-transformer], except that the property value takes
the structure instance as an argument before the syntax object to
transform.

The @racket[code-transformer?] predicate returns @racket[#t] for a
value produced by @racket[make-code-transformer] or for an instance of
a structure type with the @racket[prop:code-transformer] property,
@racket[#f] otherwise.

  (inset (frame (code ((copy cat) in the bag))) 2))
]}


@defform[(define-exec-code (pict-id runnable-id string-id)
           datum ...)]{

Binds @racket[pict-id] to the result of @racket[(code datum ...)],
except that if an identifier @racketidfont{_} appears anywhere in a
@racket[datum], then the identifier and the following expression are
not included for @racket[code].

Meanwhile, @racket[runnable-id] is bound to a @|stx-obj| that wraps
the @racket[datum]s in a @racket[begin]. In this case,
@racketidfont{_}s are removed from the @racket[datum]s, but not the
following expression. Thus, an @racketidfont{_} identifier is used to
comment out an expression from the pict, but have it present in the
@|stx-obj| for evaluation.

The @racket[string-id] is bound to a string representation of the code
that is in the pict. This string is useful for copying to the
clipboard with @racket[(send the-clipboard set-clipboard-string
string-id 0)].}


@defform[(define-exec-code/scale scale-expr (pict-id runnable-id string-id)
